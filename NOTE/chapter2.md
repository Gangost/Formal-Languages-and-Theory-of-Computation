## 2.1 Context-Free Grammars (CFGs)

### Definition
```
A context-free grammar is a 4-tuple (V, Σ, R, S), where
1. V is a finite set called the variables,
2. Σ is a finite set, disjoint from V , called the terminals,
3. R is a finite set of rules, with each rule being a variable and a
string of variables and terminals, and 
4. S ∈ V is the start variable.
```
If u, v, and w are strings of variables and terminals, and A → w is a rule of the grammar, we say that `uAv yields uwv`, written `uAv ⇒ uwv`. <br/>
Say that `u derives v`, written `u ⇒∗ v`, <br/>
if u = v or if a sequence u1,u2,...,uk exists for k ≥ 0 and
u⇒u1 ⇒u2 ⇒...⇒uk ⇒v.

**Example:**
```
consider grammar G3 = ({S}, {a,b}, R, S). The set of rules, R, is
S →aSb|SS|ε.
This grammar generates strings such as abab, aaabbb, and aababb
```

### Ambiguity

**Ambiguous:** A string w is derived ambiguously in context-free grammar G if it has two or more different leftmost derivations. Grammar G is ambiguous if it generates some string ambiguously.

**Inherently ambiguous:** The context-free languages that can be generated only by ambiguous grammars are called inherently ambiguous.

### Chomsky Normal Form

```
A → BC 
A → a
we permit the rule S → ε, where S is the start variable.
```

- Any context-free language is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form.
    >Proof:
    1. Add a new start variable;
  1. Eliminate all ε rules (A → ε);
  2. Handle all unit rules (A → B);
  3. Convert all rules into the proper form.
